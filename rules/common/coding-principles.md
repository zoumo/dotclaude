# Language-Agnostic Coding Principles

These principles apply to all programming languages and should guide code review and development decisions.

## Clarity

- Code must explain "what" and "why"
- Descriptive variable names over brevity
- Clarity trumps cleverness
- Write code as readable as narrative

## Simplicity

- Prefer standard tools over custom solutions
- Least mechanism principle
- Top-to-bottom readability
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction levels

## Concision

- High signal-to-noise ratio
- Avoid redundant comments (don't repeat code)
- Use common idioms
- Boost important signals with comments

## Maintainability

- Code is modified more than written
- Easy to modify correctly
- Clear assumptions
- No hidden critical details
- Predictable naming patterns
- Minimize dependencies

## Consistency

- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Local consistency acceptable when not harming readability
- Style deviations not acceptable if they worsen existing issues

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Avoid duplicate logic
- Use abstraction when complexity justifies it

## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Prefer simple solutions
- Avoid premature optimization
